# Music-Genre-Classification
This repository contains a project for audio genre classification using machine learning models, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Transformer model. The project is built with Streamlit for easy deployment of the model for online inference. The models were trained on the GTZAN music genre dataset.
